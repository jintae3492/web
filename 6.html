<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text,
  and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside.
   Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in
   relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary
   prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different
    display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and
    positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to
    know about.
